            <h2>About The Larch</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Larches are conifers in the genus Larix, of the family Pinaceae (subfamily Laricoideae). Growing from 20
                to 45 metres (65 to 150 feet) tall, they are native to much of the cooler temperate northern
                hemisphere, on lowlands in the north and high on mountains further south. Larches are among the dominant
                plants in the boreal forests of Siberia and Canada. Although they are conifers, larches are deciduous
                trees that lose their needles in the autumn.</p>

            <h3>Why Do Larch Needles Turn Yellow and Fall Off?</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/58/Nature_in_Khanty-Mansiya.jpg/330px-Nature_in_Khanty-Mansiya.jpg"

                Larch trees, also known as tamarack, are not true evergreen trees like pine and fir trees. They are
                deciduous, meaning in the fall as temperatures change and light decreases, they sequester nutrients from
                their needles (mostly nitrogen) for storage. As part of this process, the needles turn yellow then drop
                off. This adaptation of storing nutrients and dropping their needles make larch trees well suited for
                our tough climate. For example, larch trees are less likely to lose branches from heavy snow loads,
                compared to evergreen trees that retain their needles. The ability to produce new needles every year
                also makes larch more resilient to insect and fire damage.

            <h3>Diseases</h3>
            <p>Larches are prone to the fungal canker disease Lachnellula ssp. (larch canker); this is particularly a
                problem on sites prone to late spring frosts, which cause minor injuries to the tree allowing entry to
                the fungal spores. In Canada, this disease was first detected in 1980 and is particularly harmful to an
                indigenous species larch, the tamarack, killing both young and mature trees. Larches are also
                vulnerable to Phytophthora ramorum. In late 2009 the disease was first found in Japanese larch trees in
                the English counties of Devon, Cornwall and Somerset, and has since spread to the south-west of
                Scotland. In August 2010 the disease was found in Japanese larch trees in counties Waterford and
                Tipperary in Ireland and in 2013 in the Afan Forest Park in south Wales. Laricifomes officinalis
                is another mushroom found in Europe, North America and northern Asia that causes internal wood rot. It
                is almost exclusive guest of the gen. Larix. Other diseases are given by mushrooms, fungal rusts,
                bacteria and insects.</p>

                Larch wood is valued for its tough, waterproof and durable qualities. Top quality knot-free timber is in
                great demand for building yachts and other small boats, for exterior cladding of buildings, and interior
                paneling. The timber is resistant to rot when in contact with the ground, and is suitable for use as
                posts and in fencing. The hybrid Dunkeld larch is widely grown as a timber crop in Northern Europe,
                valued for its fast growth and disease resistance. (EN 350-2 lists larch as slightly to moderately
                durable; this would make it unsuitable for ground contact use without preservative in temperate
                climates, and would give it a limited life as external cladding without coatings.)

                Larch on oak was the traditional construction method for Scottish fishing boats in the 19th century.
                Larch has also been used in herbal medicine; see Bach flower remedies and Arabinogalactan for details.
                <br><br>
                In Central Europe larch is viewed as one of the best wood materials for the building of
                residences.[citation needed] Planted on borders with birch, both tree species were used in pagan
                cremations.[citation needed] Larches are often used in bonsai culture, where their knobby bark, small
                needles, fresh spring foliage, and – especially – autumn colour are appreciated. European larch,
                Japanese larch, and Tamarack larch are the species most commonly trained as bonsai. The edible larch
                boletes grow in symbiotic association with larch trees.
