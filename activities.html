            <h2>Larch Valley</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                Every fall, ‘larch madness’ sweeps through Alberta, transforming the alpine valleys in the Rocky
                Mountains with a rich tapestry of golden and sunshine-yellow leaves.
                <br><br>
                The spellbinding season is a quick one, lasting just a few weeks from September to early October when
                coniferous larches shed their needles, turning from green to gold before the needles drop. Witnessing
                the seasonal spectacle by doing one of the larch hikes is one of the best things to do during fall in
                Alberta, and a pastime that lures people from around the world.
            </p>
            <h3>The Larch Valley hike</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="https://s23835.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Alberta-Banff-Larch-Valley.jpg" alt="">One
                of the most popular trails is the Larch Valley and Sentinel Pass hike near Lake Louise. It
                has incredible views of the famous Valley of the Ten Peaks, which is so beautiful a photo of it
                has actually made it onto Canada’s $20 bill.
                <br><br>
                Starting at the gem-toned Moraine Lake, it takes about two hours to hike to Larch Valley and Minnestimma
                Lake, which is a steady ascent over four kilometres. From there, you can continue another 2.5 kilometres
                up the steep switchbacks to the top of windy Sentinel Pass, which overlooks Paradise Valley and the
                Larch Valley.
                <br><br>
                Since Larch Valley/Sentinel Pass gets busy during fall, the Moraine Lake parking lot is usually full as
                early as 6:30 am. Visitors may have to park in an overflow lot instead, and take a free shuttle bus to
                the trailhead. Another option is to park in Banff, and ride Roam Public Transit to Moraine Lake.
                <br><br>
                Distance: 11.6 km
                <br>
                Elevation gain: 725 m
            </p>
            <h3>Other places to see golden larch trees in fall</h3>
            <p>While the Larch Valley trail is the best known and most popular route, there are plenty of other spots to
                see the golden trees that transform the Bow Valley around Banff and Canmore. Some of the best include:
            <ul>
                <li>Taylor Lake: The trailhead for this hike starts near Lake Louise, and is treed in a good portion of
                    the way until you get to the stunning lookout point over Taylor Lake, which is framed by Mount Bell
                    and Panorama Peak. Budget a full day since it’s more than six kilometres each way, and keep in mind
                    the extra effort is worth it since there will be less people on the trail.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distance: 12.6 km</li>
                        <li>Elevation gain: 585 m</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Big Beehive: With big views looking down on turquoise Lake Louise, this is another popular larch
                    hike in Banff National Park. The Big Beehive trailhead starts along the shoreline northwest of the
                    Fairmont Chateau Lake Louise, and passes by Lake Agnes and the Lake Agnes Teahouse before reaching
                    the panoramic Big Beehive Lookout. It takes about four to five hours roundtrip, and there are also
                    options to branch off to the Devil’s Thumb or Little Beehive trails.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distance: 10.3 km</li>
                        <li>Elevation gain: 646 m</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>Healey Pass: The Sunshine Village ski resort transforms into a wildflower-filled valley in the
                    summer months, and it’s equally glorious during autumn. Starting from the hill’s overflow lot, it’s
                    a steady but moderate climb up to Healy Creek, where the trail eventually opens up into an alpine
                    meadow complete with a lake, alpine ridge and plenty of golden larch trees.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Distance: 17.5 km</li>
                        <li>Elevation gain: 655 m</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
